-My program runs through the terminal
-Language: Python Version 3.x
-All libraries used are imported at the top of the code

To start, run the program and follow the prompts in the terminal. Note that the user is not allowed to book a listing until they have searched for a listing. Just follow the
instructions in the terminal by typing in the write prompt shown between quotation marks, for example, "Search Listings" or "Write Review". You can see short comments 
explaining how my code works within the source code. 

*PLEASE NOTE THAT PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK WITH PYTHON VERSION 2.7*
